//Ques:- create a base class vehicle with a property brand and a method drive() that prints the brand name,driving this vehicle. create two subclasses one is car one is bike. the car will have an extra property that hold the value of number of doors , bike will have an extra property type . create an array of type vehicle that stores different objects both for car and bike , loop through the array and use is to check the type of the object . Use as? to downcast and print the subclass specific property . *challenge , try using as!(force casting) and observe what will happen if the casting gets failed .
